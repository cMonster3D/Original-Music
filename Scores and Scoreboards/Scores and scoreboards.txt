VERSE 1
        C               G           A                 F
I would walk around the ocean but I get this sea sick notion
       C               G               F
every time that I look out of my front door
        C           G            A                    F
and I'd probly feel better but I just don't like this weather
     C               G                F
so I wind up sitting home and feeling poor
      C               G             A                F
and I know that I'm a chooser but I just feel like a loser
      C                G               F
and I hope to god that n'one's keeping score


BRIDGE 1
    F                     G                C     F
but thats what scores and score boards are for
        F                G                C      F
I would go to work but I can't afford the store     <skip this line>
            F             G               C      F
sometimes I feel like I'm fighting back a war
            F               G               C      G         F
when all my dreams and aspirations just get washed up on the shore

C             G                A       F
heres to your health friend, a dollar helps
      C              G               F
I can see it in your eyes and in the stars
       C                G                 A                  F
and if you don't wanna lose it but you're just too scared to use it
         C                  G              F
You can leave it (*in the glove box) of my car                                   (*on the dash board)
           C              G           A                          F
and if it makes you feel better I can stay 'round (*through this weather)           (*til november)
       C              G              F
and I promise not to drive away too far


BRIDGE 2
F    F              G           C      F
Bu't driven far is why I have a car
      F                        G           C           F
A'nd stickin' 'round too much longer ju'st feels so bizar
       F                    G        C         G        F    Wait... 2,3,4.5,6,7
and I love you but I can't afford to drive you too the stars
        F             G                   C       fades to end
yeah I love you but I don't know where to start
